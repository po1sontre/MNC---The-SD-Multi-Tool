    ./sd_multi_tool.sh
    ```

2. **Edit Configuration**: Modify the `sd_multi_tool.conf` file to set default values such as the SD card mount point.

    - Set the source directory before copying.
    - Select a file to copy from the source directory to the SD card.

2. **Delete a File from the SD Card**:
    - Choose a file to delete from the SD card and confirm the deletion.

3. **Backup Menu**:
    - **Copy All Files from SD Card**: Backup all files from the SD card to a local directory.
    - **Copy All Files to SD Card**: Copy all files from a local directory to the SD card.

4. **Format SD Card**:

5. **Set a New Source Directory**:
    - Choose a new source directory for file operations.

6. **Mount SD Card (Manual)**:

### Error Handling

- Errors are logged to `/tmp/rsync.log`. Check this file for detailed error messages if something goes wrong.

## Configuration File

The `sd_multi_tool.conf` file is created automatically and can be modified:

```bash
# Example configuration file (sd_multi_tool.conf)
MOUNT_POINT="/media/sdcard"
SOURCE_DIR="$HOME/Downloads"
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the mount point directory exists and is writable.
- Formatting the SD card will erase all data. Ensure that all important data is backed up.
